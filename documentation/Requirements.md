# Requirements - LoveTap
## Introduction
 Our main goal for our project was to integrate the software world with the electrical world. We used microcontroller MPIO ports in order to link the two worlds.
## Roles
- Connor Meads - Programming
    - Find and research how to code a Rasberry Pi using Python coding.
    - Create program using libraries to track and manipulate MPIO ports.
- Benjamin Meads - Circuit design
    - Find necessary circuits to achieve required goals of project.
    - Determine what mechanical features are needed to acomplish project.
## Functional Requirements
- User must be able to pick up phone and activate recording.
    - User must recieve confirmation via LED light that they are in fact being recorded.
    - User should be able to give any length of message.
- User should be able to end recording by placing the headset back on the stand.
- Reliablitly
    - Project must preform with confidence of proper and expected output approximently 95% of the time.
- Quality
    - Audio recordings must be clear and easy to understand as to not upset any bride involved.
